FMS-Project
===========

This is a very old (2011) project that I had done during my 2nd year in college, for the course "Project in File Management Systems".

The project manages binary strings, all the way up to providing a simple API to manipulate virtual files, just like an actual file management system. It does so by organizing the files in an allocation table using a hash function. 

This is not only an interesting use case for C++, which showcases its capabilities pretty well. It is also an excellent example of thorough software engineering, building a complex system layer by layer.

You can find all the details in "Final Report.docx" under the folder "Level 4 GUI". The actual requirements file, "FMSLabfinal.pdf", was unfortunately written in Hebrew. But the resulting code is straighforward anyway, It is provided under the form of Visual Studio .SLN projects.

My grade was 100.
